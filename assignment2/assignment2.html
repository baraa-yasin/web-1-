    <p>I am a web developer who enjoys creating interactive websites and applications. In my free time, I like to stay active by playing table tennis, and I express my creativity through painting. I also have a passion for farming and nature, which brings balance to my life. Additionally, I find joy in reading books as they broaden my horizons and fuel my constant curiosity.</p>

<p>When I grow up, I want to continue expanding my skills in web development, becoming a leader in the tech industry. I aim to create innovative, user-friendly digital solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives. Alongside that, I aspire to combine my passion for creativity, technology, and nature, perhaps by working on projects related to sustainable farming or environmental technology. Ultimately, I want to be someone who contributes to a better future while staying true to my hobbies and interests.</p>
